<h3>Installing My Project Onto Your Machine(Windows only)</h3>

Note: If you have react-native installed on your machines, skip 1-4 points.<br>
1. Firstly, Install Node and set it as environment variable.<br>
2. Open command prompt and type this command <blockquote>npm install -g expo-cli</blockquote><br>
3. Then, create a new project(i.e., projExample) and navigate to that folder <blockquote>expo init projExample<br>cd projExample</blockquote><br>
4. After navigating to your project folder, for starting the development, type <blockquote>expo start</blockquote> and your project gets started with live development server.<br>
5. Once everything works perfectly, download my project files(Navigation, app.js, package.json) which are on this repo.<br>
6. Once the download gets complete, copy all the files(1 folder and 2 files) to your project directory.<br>
7. You need not install the dependencies which I have used in my app. Just replace 'package.json' file.<br>
8. Once you have copied 1 folder and replaced two files(package.json and app.js), open command prompt from your project directory and type 'expo start'.
